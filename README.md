# Mercator

This repository contains the design files for Mercator: an upgrade for the Sphero RVR robot that enhances its capabilities by introducing additional sensors. For more detailed information, please refer to the [technical report](https://iridia.ulb.ac.be/IridiaTrSeries/link/IridiaTr2022-012.pdf).

The [Mechanical Design](https://github.com/demiurge-project/mercator-hardware/tree/master/Mechanical%20Design) directory contains the design files for the structure that holds the additional sensors in DXF format for laser-cutting purposes. The supports for the top and bottom plates and the sensors (2 battery supports, 8 distance-sensor supports and 1 UWB module support) are assembled by slotting them into the corresponding holes on the plates.
